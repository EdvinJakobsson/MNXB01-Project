PROJECT PLAN
Johan Book, Edvin Jakobsson, Sara Gabriella
MNXB01 2017-10-27

Idea
  compare average temperature between places (using overlay with semi-transparent graphs)
  calculate difference in temperature for each place over the years (data from Uppsala)
  
  Prove global warming in Uppsala
  
  Look into how it affects the location of the hottest and the coldest day in a year
  
  Edvin:	Look into global warming - Create one or several histograms over the average temperature over the different years in the Uppsala data.
  Sara: 	Look into how the hottest and coldest day switches over time and look for patterns. Create a histogram over the hottest/coldest day over the different years. Compare with gobal warming.
  Johan:	Compare the average temperature changes in different areas (data sets). Create a histogram over average temperature for several areas over the different years, or the different days. Create cool image

Objects
  main - the main method that generates and stores relevant graphs (?)
  treader - object to reads data line by line and convert it into tpoints (Johan Book) 
  tpoint - object that stores one point in time-temp. space (Johan Book)
