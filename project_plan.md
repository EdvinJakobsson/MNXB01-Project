##Ideas
- Compare average temperature between places (using overlay with semi-transparent graphs)
- Prove global warming in Uppsala
  -Calculate difference in temperature for each place over the years (data from Uppsala)
- Look into how it affects the location of the hottest and the coldest day in a year
  
####Edvin
Look into global warming - Create one or several histograms over the average temperature over the different years in the Uppsala data.

####Sara 	
Look into how the hottest and coldest day switches over time and look for patterns. Create a histogram over the hottest/coldest day over the different years. Compare with gobal warming.

####Johan
Compare the average temperature changes in different areas (data sets). Create a histogram over average temperature for several areas over the different years, or the different days. Create cool image
